## Proxy-Cheap Reviews

### Positive Aspects

Proxy-Cheap has earned recognition for its affordable pricing structure that significantly undercuts competitors while maintaining acceptable performance levels for basic to moderate use cases. The service boasts impressive statistics with over 45,000 satisfied clients and maintains 99.9% uptime, demonstrating reliability for ongoing operations. Users appreciate the straightforward setup process and user-friendly dashboard that simplifies proxy management regardless of technical expertise.

The platform's extensive geographic coverage spanning 127 countries with 7 million+ IP resources provides substantial flexibility for targeting specific regions. Customer support is available 24/7, and the service accepts multiple payment methods including credit cards, PayPal, and cryptocurrency, offering convenience for diverse user bases.

### Critical Considerations

Independent testing and user reviews reveal several concerns that potential customers should consider. Approximately 80-85% of user reviews report negative experiences, focusing on quality issues, IP geolocation mismatches, and customer support challenges. Common complaints include high fraud scores (80%-89%) that render proxies ineffective for social media management, e-commerce, and certain scraping applications.

Users have reported instances where proxy locations labeled as specific countries are detected as originating from different regions, causing blocks or flagging on platforms with strict security measures. The service lacks advanced enterprise features such as IP whitelisting, city-level targeting, ASN granularity, and sticky session controls. Customer support quality varies significantly, with some users experiencing unhelpful bot-driven chat responses and difficulty obtaining refunds.

### Performance Summary

Real-world testing demonstrates that Proxy-Cheap performs adequately for basic web scraping with approximately 84% unique IP rotation across large batches. Datacenter proxies show good compatibility with SEO monitoring tools and SERP tracking applications. The service works with automation frameworks like Puppeteer, Scrapy, and Selenium with minimal configuration requirements.

However, shared IP pools frequently trigger CAPTCHA challenges or blocks on high-security websites, limiting effectiveness for certain applications. For casual users or low-risk projects with budget constraints, Proxy-Cheap may provide acceptable value, but businesses requiring guaranteed geolocation accuracy, low fraud scores, or mission-critical reliability should carefully evaluate alternatives.
